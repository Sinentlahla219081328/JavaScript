# Variables and data types
####What is a Variable? -  a variable is a container for storing data.


You declare variables using  var, const and let.


var: Has function scope and can be redeclared.
let: Has block scope and can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
const: Also has block scope, but it cannot be reassigned or redeclared, making it ideal for values that should not change.
