# Variables and data types
### Variable 
A variable is a container for storing data.

You declare variables using  var, const and let.

+ **var**: Has function scope and can be redeclared.
+ **let**: Has block scope and can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
+ **const**: Also has block scope, but it cannot be reassigned or redeclared, making it ideal for values that should not chan
###  Data Types:
   A data type define the type of data that a variable can hold.
### Common Data Types:
+ **Numbers**: Used for numeric values (e.g., integers and floating-point numbers).
+ **Strings**: A sequence of characters used to represent text.
+ **Booleans**: Represents true or false, typically used in conditions and logical operations.
+ **Arrays**: A list of values, which can be of any data type, stored in a single variable.
+ **Objects**: Complex data structures that can hold multiple values and functions (methods) as properties.

# Operators and expressions

**Operators** are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values (operands). 

### Types of Operators:
+ Arithmetic Operators:

Used for mathematical calculations.
**Examples**: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus), and ** (exponentiation).

+ Assignment Operators:

Used to assign values to variables.
**Examples**: = (assign), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), *= (multiply and assign), /= (divide and assign).

+ Comparison Operators:

Used to compare values and return a boolean (true or false).
**Examples**: == (equal), != (not equal), === (strict equal), !== (strict not equal), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to).

+ Logical Operators:

Used to combine multiple conditions.
**Examples**: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT).

+ Unary Operators:

Operate on a single operand.
**Examples**: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), typeof (type of operand).

+ Ternary Operator:

A shorthand for an if-else statement.
**Example**: condition ? expression1 : expression2.

**Expressins**An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a single value. Expressions can be simple (e.g., a single value or variable) or complex (involving multiple operators and operands).

### Types of Expressions:

+ Arithmetic Expressions:

Use arithmetic operators to perform calculations.
**Example**: let total = price * quantity;

+ Comparison Expressions:

Use comparison operators to evaluate conditions.
**Example**: let isAdult = age >= 18;

+ Logical Expressions:
Combine multiple conditions using logical operators.
**Example**: let canVote = (age >= 18) && (citizen === true);
