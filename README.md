# Variables and data types
### Variable 
A variable is a container for storing data.

You declare variables using  var, const and let.

+ **var**: Has function scope and can be redeclared.
+ **let**: Has block scope and can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
+ **const**: Also has block scope, but it cannot be reassigned or redeclared, making it ideal for values that should not chan
###  Data Types:
   A data type define the type of data that a variable can hold.
### Common Data Types:
+ **Numbers**: Used for numeric values (e.g., integers and floating-point numbers).
+ **Strings**: A sequence of characters used to represent text.
+ **Booleans**: Represents true or false, typically used in conditions and logical operations.
+ **Arrays**: A list of values, which can be of any data type, stored in a single variable.
+ **Objects**: Complex data structures that can hold multiple values and functions (methods) as properties.

# Operators and expressions

**Operators** are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values (operands). 

### Types of Operators:
+ Arithmetic Operators:
  
 Used for mathematical calculations.
**Examples**: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus), and ** (exponentiation).
